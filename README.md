### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm TRAN Gia Quoc Bao. I was born and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying towards a Master of Engineering ("Formation d'ingÃ©nieurs") Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems at the Institute of Engineering and Management at UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes (UGA), France. The medium of instruction is French, while some courses are in English.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on research at GIPSA-lab, a joint research unit between the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and UGA.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am actively looking for PhD/short-term research opportunities in Control/Robotics for late 2021. If you offer such an opportunity, thank you for letting me know.
